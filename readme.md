This quick and dirty utility was originally built to speed up the process of merging art assets. Artists can use this utility to package up and release sets of art that end users can quickly merge into the clients they are using.

Current Features:
Copy art assets between sets of MUL files
(optional) Copy tiledata at the same time as art assets
Copy art to a clipboard
View art sets side by side or independently
Saves new set of art with _ after filename in the same folder
Planned features (if I get around to them):
UOP Support
Radar Col support
Create blank asset files
Save Dialogues
Jump to index
Better UI
This utility has lots of bugs and it is not optimized. I never really intended to release it, and updates to it will be slow. I will post the source code for it soon for those that want to help develop it or submit bug fixes.
